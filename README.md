# Custom hooks collection

Utility hooks I've written that could be helpful to you too.

## Hooks

1. [**useRoute**](./lib/useRoute) - React to changes in the browser URL.
1. [**useDebounce**](./lib/useDebounce) - React with delay to changes of an input text.
1. [**useFilterCollection**](./lib/useFilterCollection) - Search or reduce a list of anything by matching a term.
1. [**useSearchParams**](./lib/useSearchParams) - Syncronhize a form with the search params of the browser's URL. **This one is killer** - check it out.
